Reinforcement Learning tools for research
=========================================

This repository contains the code developped and used by Aymeric CÃ”ME, to conduct experiments in RL.

Dependencies
============

The project is managed using `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_, and the dependencies are specified in `pyproject.toml`.

The development has been made in Python 3.10, and relies on the `Gym <https://github.com/openai/gym>`_ library.

When possible, `rlberry <https://github.com/rlberry-py/rlberry>`_ is also used. This library relies on Gym as well, and provides in particular the ``Chain`` and ``GridWorld`` built-in environments.


Testing
=======
This module uses `Pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/>`_ as a testing framework. The unitary tests are located in `tests/`, and can be run with the following command from root:
::
   pytest

Credits
=======

Numerous pieces of codes in this repository are largely inspired by `<https://gitlab.inria.fr/omaillar/average-reward-reinforcement-learning/>`_, developped by Odalric MAILLARD.
